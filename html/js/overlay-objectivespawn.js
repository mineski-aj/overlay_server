/* ── [FEATURE: objective-spawn] ──
   Full-canvas video that plays the instant the Lord or Turtle jungle
   timer actually counts down to spawn. Lord and Turtle share one
   full-screen video element (they never spawn in the same instant in a
   real game) and are queued the same way kill events are if they ever
   do land in the same poll tick.

   Guard — must NOT fire just because a poll reads tortoise_left_time/
   lord_left_time as 0. Both fields sit at 0 before their timer has
   started (e.g. the moment the overlay is opened mid-game), so a plain
   "== 0" check would fire immediately on load. Only fire on an actual
   POSITIVE → 0 transition observed between two polls — i.e. the timer
   was seen ticking down, not just resting at zero. This also makes each
   feature naturally re-armed for every subsequent spawn (spawns happen
   more than once per match): once the timer counts back up for the next
   cycle, the next 1→0 transition fires again on its own. */
